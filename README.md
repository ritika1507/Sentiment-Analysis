# Sentiment-Analysis with deep learning

The hands on project on Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning using BERT is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: An introduction to some basic theory behind BERT, and the problem we will be using it to solve
Task 2: Explore dataset distribution and some basic preprocessing
Task 3: Split dataset into training and validation using stratified approach
Task 4: Loading pretrained tokenizer to encode our text data into numerical values (tensors)
Task 5: Load in pretrained BERT with custom final layer
Task 6: Create dataloaders to facilitate batch processing
Task 7: Choose and optimizer and scheduler to control training of model
Task 8: Design performance metrics for our problem
Task 9: Create a training loop to control PyTorch finetuning of BERT using CPU or GPU acceleration
Task 10: Load in a pre-saved finetuned BERT model and evaluate its performance, and some final thoughts
